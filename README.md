PR2 Gripper Simulation and Data Collection

This project demonstrates a simulation of a PR2 robotic gripper using PyBullet. The simulation enables the gripper to perform random grasp attempts on an object (e.g., a small cube), evaluate the grasp quality, and save the collected data for further analysis.
